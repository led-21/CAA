# Augmentative and Alternative Communication

## About the Project

**CAA** (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) is an application designed to facilitate communication for individuals with speech difficulties, using pictograms and simple phrases. It allows users to **build messages visually** and have them **spoken aloud** through text-to-speech functionality.

## Features

* **Message Building:** Users can create sentences by selecting pictograms that represent words, feelings, actions, and routines.
* **Categories:** Images are organized into categories such as *Information* (Yes, No, Like, Tired, Happy, Sad, Hurt, Scared) and *Routine* (Morning, Afternoon, Night, School, Home, Bath, Tired).
* **Intuitive Interface:** Simple navigation with large buttons and illustrative icons, making it easy for both children and adults to use.
* **“Speak” Button:** After building a sentence, users can tap “Speak” for the app to vocalize the message.
* **History:** Keeps track of sent messages for review or repetition.

## Target Audience

* People with speech or communication difficulties (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, etc.).
* Educators, therapists, and family members who assist with communication development.
